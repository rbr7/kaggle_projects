## 1)  Titanic - Machine learning from Disaster
   ### link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

The task was to use the Titanic dataset and generate a model to understand what characteristics of passengers, such as ticket costs, age, etc., affected their chances of survival, and use this data to accurately predict survival.

-Performed EDA on the popular Titanic dataset, utilizing statistical modelling techniques and feature selection/engineering to generate useful input data. 
-Generated multiple statistical models to analyze correlations and reveal underlying characteristics. 
-Constructed and implemented a density based anomaly detection using K-means. 
-Using sci-kit-learn, implemented an ensemble model that used a combination of Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, and SVM. 
-Constructed and implemented a Deep Neural Network Classifier using tensorflow.
